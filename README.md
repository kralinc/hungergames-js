# hungergames-js
New hunger games simulator in javascript

Play it here: https://kralinc.github.io/hungergames-js/

## To run locally
Clone the repo or download it as a zip file. Due to the use of JavaScript modules, a local server is required to run this app locally.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server and https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php are both good options for this.

All that should be needed is to run the server in the directory containing the index.html file.
